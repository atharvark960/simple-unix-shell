# simple-unix-shell
This project, aims to develop a simple Unix shell in the C programming language. A Unix shell is a command-line interpreter that provides a user interface for accessing and managing the operating system's services. The shell will follow the standard read-parse-execute loop, which is fundamental to most shell environments. This loop consists of reading user input, parsing the command and its arguments, and executing the command. The shell will support essential features such as handling built-in commands, executing external programs, managing input/output redirection, and handling background processes.
